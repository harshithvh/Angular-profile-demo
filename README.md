# Portfolio

---

A portfolio goes beyond a resume and a cover letter to show a prospective employer your work experience, skills, accomplishments, and more.

Portfolios include information about who you are and examples of your work and achievements. A traditional resume is included in a career portfolio along with written and/or visual information that highlights what you have to offer. A career portfolio will also set you apart. Despite the obvious advantages of having a portfolio, few employers see them during interviews.

1. Resume
2. Skills, Abilities 
3. Marketable Qualities
4. List of Accomplishments
5. Samples of Your Work

# Importance

---

1. The audience to your projects and work do not have an understanding of programming. 
2. During the recruitment process, the person to first look at your profile is an HR(a person who cannot understand the back-end).

# Problems faced with trsditional method

---


We have been creating web pages using core HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So we faced many challenges like:

1. Lack of standard practice in developing a website
2. Difficulties in managing reusable codes
3. Difficult to design app-like user experience

# Angular

---

Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:

1. A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
2. A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
3. A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code

A front-end framework like angular solves all the problems.

1. You can create app-like user experience
2. You can create reusable components
3. It also provides built-in security features
4. It provides a standard practice to create websites

So overall it removes the need of using core JavaScript or some other libraries like jQuery

# Material UI

---

Material UI standardised the way we create custom-designed HTML components

- You can quickly create a mobile app-like user interface.

- You can reuse the customised components.

- You can save the state of the component and also dynamically update the content.

So overall it removes the need of using core CSS or any other CSS libraries like bootstrap etc

# Angular Components

---

Angular applications are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called NgModules. 

Modules are a great way to organize an application and extend it with capabilities from external libraries.

List of Components:
1. Material Cards

Material card is part of material UI. It is basically a component that helps you to create Card like UI. It is following parts:

Header
- Title
- Subtitle
- Content
- Actions
- Footer

2. Material Chips

Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action. They allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

3. Material Lists

Lists are continuous, vertical indexes of text or images. Lists are a continuous group of text or images. They are composed of items containing primary and supplemental actions, which are represented by icons and text.

4. Material Icons

System icons are designed to be simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, expressing essential characteristics.
